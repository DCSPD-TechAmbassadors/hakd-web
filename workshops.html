                            What’s cooler than lighting LEDs up? Making music, of course! We will be using the magical Raspberry Pi Picos to do so. But that’s not it! You can do a variety of tasks with the Pico like displaying data on a screen, make motors spin, make a door lock, do score counting and much much more! Prior coding knowledge is not necessary but recommended for understanding key concepts in this workshop. Please download the Thonny python editor from <a href="https://thonny.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://thonny.org</a> and this uf2 file from Raspberry Pi Pico (<a href="https://micropython.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://micropython.org</a>) before the workshop begins.

                            Learn how to create music digitally and compose the pieces you want to make. This workshop will focus on using Ableton’s “Live 11”, a software used by many well-known artists such as David Guetta, Flume, KSHMR, and many more. The aim will be to learn the basics of music production, how to create the music you want, and how to export the music to an MP3 file. There will also be chances to export MIDI files for those who need them for other areas of HakD. If you plan to attend this workshop, please create an account, and download the demo version of Live 11 (<a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/trial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.ableton.com/en/trial/</a>).

                            Come learn about Object Oriented Programming (OOP), a programming style which offers a range of alternative benefits compared to procedural programming, which is taught in most school curriculums. We'll learn about objects, methods, inheritance and other OOP techniques. By the end of the workshop, you'll have created a Python Turtle-based object (Turtle is a drawing library), which will use inheritance and customized methods. You'll also be able to use Object Oriented Programming to solve various problems, and you'll be able to identify when it's best to use procedural or OOP techniques. A good level of Python skills is required, and you should be comfortable with procedures and functions – if you’re unsure, come talk to me before signing up.<br>
                            <br>Requirements: A good level of Python skills. Any Python IDE installed

                            In this workshop be prepared to roll up your sleeves and get up close and personal with an Arduino board! You will build and program a small control system that can control sensors, buzzers, LEDs, screens and more. In the process you will learn about analog and digital I/O (input and output) as well as some Arduino programming fundamentals. Some programming experience is recommended. Please download and install the Arduino IDE from <a href="https://arduino.cc/en/software" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://arduino.cc/en/software</a> before this workshop if possible.

                            Want to learn how to 3D model like a pro, but have no idea where to start? Then this workshop is for you! We’ll start with the basics, like sketching 2D shapes and then turning them into 3D. We’ll also do some fun challenges along the way. This is a very practical workshop, so ensure you bring your laptop! Complete beginners welcome, as well as those with some Fusion 360/3D design experience.

                            Games have a unique power to bring people together. Video games multiple this power to connect people from around the world and to explore new worlds. Yet, people with disabilities, who already experience more isolated, are often excluded even to these virtual worlds.  
                            <br>
                            <br>In this Inclusive Design Lab, we will reimagine the game controller and hack a new way into the virtual worlds of video games.
