                        <p>In this workshop be prepared to roll up your sleeves and get up close and personal with an Arduino board! You will build and program a small control system that uses sensors, buzzers, LEDs and more. In the process you will learn about analogue and digital I/O (input and output) as well as Arduino programming fundamentals. Please download and install the Arduino IDE before this workshop if possible.   
                            <br>
                            <br>This workshop is presented by Mr. Whitaker, Director of Ed Tech at DCSPD and an inspiration to his IB Computer Science class!

                        <p>My main objective of creating this workshop is to expand scratch and make more people know about it. Scratch is one of my favorite coding languages. Why? Because you can create whatever you want without months of learning (although 3d and scrolling requires more learning) and even beginners can create amazing games after my 90 minutes session. Additionally, I will teach them some tricks and tips on how to use scratch. And perhaps even teaching them something not much can imagine! Addons!
